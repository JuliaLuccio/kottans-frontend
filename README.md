I studied the materials of the Coursera course and received the certificate.
It was an interesting experience due to the lab works.

I opened for myself a command `cherry-pick`. I have not met it before in tutorials :upside_down_face:
And understood the difference between `rebace` and `merge`.

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

__Quiz1__ there was the new commands for me `pwd` and `more`.  
__Quiz2__ almost all commands were new to me except `chmod`. But here I was able to understand what these 9 symbols mean and how to edit them.  
__Quiz3__ learned that the command `cat` not only displays the contents of a file, but can also merge files.  
__Quiz4__ at this stage all the commands were new. It was educational!
